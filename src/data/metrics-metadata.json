        "Overview": "Total Sales represents the overall revenue generated from all completed orders within a selected period. It serves as a key performance indicator of business health, reflecting the combined impact of marketing, pricing, product mix, and customer demand. Monitoring Total Sales helps assess growth trends, evaluate campaign effectiveness, and guide strategic decisions across sales, finance, and operations. Net Sales represent the actual revenue after deducting returns, refunds, and discounts from Gross Sales. It reflects the real income generated from completed transactions and provides a more accurate measure of sales performance. Gross Sales represents the total revenue generated from all completed orders before any deductions such as returns, discounts, or allowances. It serves as a key measure of overall sales volume and business scale, providing a clear view of top-line performance. Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER) measures total revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising. It helps gauge overall marketing effectiveness and efficiency across all channels.",

Open Rate measures the percentage of delivered emails that were opened by recipients. Click Rate measures how many recipients clicked a link in your email relative to those who opened it. Order Rate indicates the proportion of website sessions or visitors that resulted in completed orders. Opt-Out Rate shows the percentage of users who unsubscribed or opted out of communications after receiving your messages. Delivery Rate measures the percentage of successfully delivered emails out of total sent emails. Click-Through Rate measures how often users clicked on an ad or link after seeing it. It’s a key engagement metric for ad and content performance.
