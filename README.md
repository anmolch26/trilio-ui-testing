## Blog Content Generation Workflow

This project supports generating large batches of blog posts that integrate with the dynamic slug-based blog pages under `/resources/blog-insights/:blogSlug`.

Scripts:

- Generate raw blog JSON files:
  - `npm run blogs:generate` → writes `tmp/generated-blogs/*.json`
- Validate structure and quality:
  - `npm run blogs:validate`
- Import into the app (compiles to TS and merges with core data):
  - `npm run blogs:import`
- Update sitemap and summary reports:
  - `npm run blogs:sitemap`
  - `npm run blogs:indexes`

Steps:

1. `npm run blogs:generate -- --count=200`
2. `npm run blogs:validate`
3. `npm run blogs:import`
4. `npm run blogs:sitemap`
5. Run the app and browse `/resources/blog-insights`.
